# Carbon One

> **Stable Release** — clarity, contrast, and calm.

A light theme built on the principles of IBM’s Carbon palette and Atom’s One Light. **Carbon One** was created with a single goal: to make code readable and comfortable under real-world office lighting.
Tested through months of daily use, it reconciles WCAG contrast standards with perceptual comfort, producing a background that remains stable and legible even in bright conditions.

> ℹ️ The name _Carbon One_ honors the work behind IBM’s Carbon Design System and Atom’s One Light theme. This project is not a reinterpretation or a series —it is a single, finished experiment in light, designed to achieve a balanced state between accessibility and visual ease.

> ℹ️ The HAL-9000 console icon was chosen to echo that sense of precision and restraint.

## 🧩 Design Notes

The development of _Carbon One_ spanned several months of experimentation.
The process began with the search for a neutral gray background optimized for long reading sessions.

Later, tests using albedo values and WCAG contrast metrics revealed the limitations of purely numerical criteria: high compliance did not always mean visual ease.

Further research included perceptual studies from Carnegie Mellon University on [dyslexia-friendly colors](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jbigham/pubs/pdfs/2017/colors.pdf), albedo-based luminance models, and extensive trials under different office lighting and monitor glare conditions.

The final direction came from IBM’s **Carbon Design System**, whose palette resolved many of the conflicts between contrast, consistency, and comfort. The theme’s tones were adjusted within WCAG limits but prioritized _subjective legibility_ —how the eye perceives focus and rest across time.

A decisive influence also came from **Atom One Light**, whose restrained palette demonstrated that readability could emerge from economy rather than abundance. Its carefully balanced hues redefined how syntax color could signify meaning. _Carbon One_ acknowledges that lineage — an homage to the clarity and conceptual precision that made that theme a quiet place.

Typography also proved decisive: after testing over thirty monospaced fonts, **JetBrains Mono** provided the best balance of legibility, rhythm, and endurance.

_Carbon One_ is therefore not an aesthetic variation but a synthesis: a light environment designed for the realities of coding in daylight, where clarity must coexist with calm.
