# ðŸ§¾ Development Log

The *Carbon One* project evolved through three distinct stages, each marking a new attempt to reconcile clarity, comfort, and aesthetic restraint in a light coding environment.

## v0.8 â€” Gray CLC (*July 4, 2025*)

The initial prototype.
**Gray CLC** was built around a soft gray background designed for *complex lighting conditions* â€” shared offices, overexposed monitors, and sunlight. Its goal was functional clarity above all else.
This version introduced the principle of **ambient readability**, testing the limits of background neutrality without sacrificing syntax precision.

## v0.9 â€” Albedo 0.93 (*August 3, 2025*)

The first formal release.
Here, the design took on its reflective identity: **Albedo 0.93** explored the relationship between luminance and comfort, naming itself after the calculated reflectance of its base color (`#eeeeee`).
The palette was refined toward WCAG compliance, and the concept of *measured brightness* became central. This stage established the theoretical foundation for the final work.

## v1.0 â€” Carbon One (*October 29, 2025*)

The synthesis.
Incorporating insights from **IBM's Carbon Design System** and the elegant economy of **Atom's One Light**, *Carbon One* reached its mature form: a light theme defined not by style but by **visual endurance**.
With *JetBrains Mono* as its typographic core and **subjective legibility** as its guiding principle, it completes a cycle of experimentation that began with a simple gray square and ended as a study in human perception.

# ðŸ”­ Future Work

*Carbon One* is considered complete in its conceptual form.
Future updates will focus on **incremental refinements** â€” mainly improved syntax coverage and subtle adjustments for specific languages (TypeScript).

Earlier iterations included **semantic tokens**, but these were ultimately removed due to inconsistent compiler support and the absence of a reliable standard: While they offer theoretical precision, in practice they degrade performance and introduce fragmentation across languages. The current design favors **predictable syntax scopes** and **consistent visual feedback** over speculative automation.

The foundation is now stable. Any further work will extend â€”not alterâ€” the themeâ€™s guiding principle: **clarity through constraint**.
