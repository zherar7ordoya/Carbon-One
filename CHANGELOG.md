# 🧾 Development Log

The _Carbon One_ project evolved through three distinct stages, each marking a new attempt to reconcile clarity, comfort, and aesthetic restraint in a light coding environment.

## v0.8 — Gray CLC (_July 4, 2025_)

The initial prototype.
**Gray CLC** was built around a soft gray background designed for _complex lighting conditions_ — shared offices, overexposed monitors, and sunlight. Its goal was functional clarity above all else.
This version introduced the principle of **ambient readability**, testing the limits of background neutrality without sacrificing syntax precision.

## v0.9 — Albedo 0.93 (_August 3, 2025_)

The first formal release.
Here, the design took on its reflective identity: **Albedo 0.93** explored the relationship between luminance and comfort, naming itself after the calculated reflectance of its base color (`#eeeeee`).
The palette was refined toward WCAG compliance, and the concept of _measured brightness_ became central. This stage established the theoretical foundation for the final work.

## v1.0 — Carbon One (_October 29, 2025_)

The synthesis.
Incorporating insights from **IBM's Carbon Design System** and the elegant economy of **Atom's One Light**, _Carbon One_ reached its mature form: a light theme defined not by style but by **visual endurance**. With _JetBrains Mono_ as its typographic core and **subjective legibility** as its guiding principle, it completes a cycle of experimentation that began with a simple gray square.

## v2.0 - Carbon One (_November 23, 2025_)

-   The original code colorization proposal lacked a coherent environment. Therefore, to achieve a more complete visual identity, I incorporated elements that I felt aligned with the proposed color scheme.
-   For the code colorization palette, additional values ​​(always at level 60) from the IBM Carbon System color palette have been added.

# 🔭 Future Work

_Carbon One_ is considered complete in its conceptual form.
Future updates will focus on **incremental refinements** — mainly improved syntax coverage and subtle adjustments for specific languages.

Earlier iterations included **semantic tokens**, but these were ultimately removed due to inconsistent compiler support and the absence of a reliable standard: While they offer theoretical precision, in practice they degrade performance and introduce fragmentation across languages. The current design favors **predictable syntax scopes** and **consistent visual feedback** over speculative automation.

The foundation is now stable. Any further work will extend —not alter— the theme’s guiding principle: **clarity through constraint**.
